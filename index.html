      How Does an Average Joe (With Anarcho-Communist Tendencies) Like Me Make
      Explosives Which Cannot Be Tracked/Contolled by a Tyrannical Regime (AKA
      Any Government with Laws)

    </h3>
    <p class="para">
      If you're anything like me, you hate being told what to do. Among the many
      ridiculous so-called "laws" which our oligarchical overlords have imposed
      upon the innocent proletariat of America is legislation against
      canabalistically imbibing the blended remains of the bourgeosie, otherwise
      called, "eating the rich."
    </p>
    <p class="para">
      One extremely useful tool in usurping the self-crowned tyrants of the
      monopoly capitalist shadow government is
      <strong>high-grade explosive devices.</strong> In order for us comrades to
      arm ourselves, we must first learn how to produce such arms without
      alerting the elitist authorities. In the following webpage, I will explain
      how to make a bomb without that nosy bitch many call "the government"
      getting all up in your bidness.

      />
    <p class="para">
      This is by far the most pesky step in constructing a high-grade explosive
      device. Now, even though I'm a super duper smart and intelligent man (my
      friend's mom even called me a genius one time), I don't know a lot about
      cyber security. Knowlege of cyber security is one of your best friends
      when doing anything that the slobbering, money-devouring swine in the
      capital building have allegedly decided is "illegal." So here are some
      foundational pillars for using cyber security to the behest of the working
      class:
    </p>
    <ul id="listdabomb">
      <li><b>Tor Browser</b></li>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        Tor Browser is the internet outlaw's bestest best friend. Tor is
        actually an acronym for "The Onion Router." The Onion Router is named
        after its ability to send your information through three different
        routers which, when investigated, act as a sort of three-layered mask.
        This makes your internet activity almost if not completely anonymous,
        even to your internet provider.
      </p>
      <li><b>Use a VPN</b></li>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        There are plenty of VPNs which can operate in tandem with Tor. Many
        sources on the internet prestent using Tor or a VPN as an either/or
        situation, but those people are actually just robots made by the
        government to trick you into getting caught so that they can butcher
        you, lay your carcass in the sun and serve your dried meat to hedgefund
        managers. According to some sources, Windscribe is the best free VPN for
        Tor, but I encourage you to do your own research. Again, this is
        <b>not an instruction manual on how to bomb things</b>, it's more of a
        public announcement pointing to the fact that this information is
        available to the public.

      <li><b>Use the Hidden Wiki</b></li>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        The Hidden Wiki, as well as a myriad of dark web link directories, can
        point you in the direction of the materials you need. As to what those
        materials are, we'll get to that laterðŸ˜ˆ. Most of the sites that you'll
        be getting your materials from won't actually be on the dark web, as the
        chemicals themselves aren't illegal, though they are surveiled by the
        <b>prying eyes of TYRANNY!</b> So doing as much as you can to remain
        covert is going to be integral in <i>not</i> having the FBI show up at
        your house.
      </p>
      <li><b>Don't be Stupid</b></li>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        If you go to sites that can only be accessed on the dark web, there are
        definitely going to be tons and tons of scammers and straight up
        crimminals whose actual job is to steal your information or disrupt any
        of the nodes which go from you to the internet and back again. One tip
        I've heard, for example, is if you download a file while using the Tor
        browser, if the file then reconnects on its own to the internet, then
        your information will be made visible in all of the places the
        government to look for it. Little tricks like this can lead to the
        downfall of even the best, coolest, most sexy anarchists out there. Of
        course, always practice internet safety, and do so tenfold when browsing
        the dark web.

      Now that you know how to be a hot and sexy dark web <b>god</b>, you can
      now begin to stock your supplies. The recipe I'll be using for today's
      "meal" comes from renowned chef William Powell's infamous work,
      <i>The Anarchist Cookbook</i>. I have not tested this recipe, nor will I
      be close to testing this any time soon, so this is more of a jumping-off
      point for building an actual bomb. According to my good boy Willie, we are
      going to need the following:

    <h2>5-Minute-Crafts Military-Grade Explosive</h2>
    <p class="para">
      Now that you've got all of your materials, I am going to provide here the
      actual recipe for dynamite as provided in the very cool, very nice, very
      patriotic <i>The Anarchist Cookbook.</i> To preface the recipe, Willie-boy
      talks a little about TNT, saying that it's one of the most important
      modern explosives. This is true: TNT is very stable, does not forfeit
      power for stability, melts at 82Â° C, and is overall just incredibly
      multi-faceted. The vast majority of explosive devices denotated in the
      Cookbook utilize TNT, particularly the milk-can-hand-grenade. The Cookbook
      can be found anywhere online for those interested.
    </p>
    <ol id="roman">
      <li>
        Take two beakers. In the first, prepare a solution of 76 percent
        sulfuric acid, 23 percent nitric acid, and 1 percent water. In the other
        beaker, prepare another solution of 57 percent nitric acid and 43
        percent sulfuric acid (percentages are on a weight ratio rather than
        volume).
      </li>
      <li>
        Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an empty beaker and
        placed in an ice bath.
      </li>
      <li>Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
        degrees C. The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
        degrees C. The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 10 or 12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath,
        and cooled to 45 degrees C. When reaching this temperature, the oily
        liquid will sink and collect at the bottom of the beaker. At this point,
        the remaining acid solution should be drawn off, by using a syringe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
        while the temperature is slowly being raised to 83 degrees C. After this
        temperature is reached, it is maintained for a full half hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to cool to 60 degrees
        C., and is held at this temperature for another full half hour. After
        this, the acid is again drawn off, leaving once more only the oily
        liquid at the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
        heated to 80 degrees C. All temperature increases must be accomplished
        slowly and gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second acid
        solution are added, and the temperature is raised from 80 degrees C. to
        104 degrees C., and is held for three hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        After this three-hour period, the mixture is lowered to 100 degrees C.
        and is held there for a half hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        After this half hour, the oil is removed from the acid and washed with
        boiling water.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the washing with boiling water, while being stirred constantly,
        the TNT will begin to solidify.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the solidification has started, cold water is added to the beaker,
        so that the TNT will form into pellets. Once this is done, you have a
        good quality TNT.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para">
      And that's it! You have successfully made one of the most dangerous
      explosives known to man! All that's left to do is stick a blast cap in
      whatever container you want to put the TNT in and light the fuse.
      Congratulations on becoming a true Anarchist and a warrior for the
      Proletariat. Cheers!

      <h2>Why Is This Information Important?</h2>

      <p class="para">
        This webpage <em>is</em> intended primarily as a joke, but I think it's
        necessary to adress <strong>why</strong> this information is available
        to the public and why it's important that things stay this way. This is,
        in earnest, a deeply unnerving, maybe frightening topic in any
        discussion. Yet, in pursuit of earnestness, we must realize that our
        fears are withholding us from talking about a topic which, gone
        undiscussed, will inevitably destroy more people's lives and
        livelihoods.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        When I first learned that this information was so widely available, I
        remember feeling shocked; I remember feeling frightened. These feelings
        are totally understandable and valid. I had condemned the people who
        spread this information as violent terrorists. That was before I
        realized that precedent,
        <b>in a world that has begun to relish cruelty and foul play</b>*, does
        not elicit action. So, people who want to witness societal change must
        toe the line between violent and peaceful activism. Too much violence,
        and it begins a vicious cycle; too little violence, and the cause will
        be trampled by those who are willing to be violent.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        I believe that this is the sentiment which the founding fathers held
        when they authored the Second Amendment, that which is used all too
        often to defend "the right to bear arms" was penned for the express
        purpose of ensuring that we the people would have the right not to turn
        the muzzle on our fellow patriots, but the right to indeed "bear arms"
        against our opressors. The point of the second amendment is not to make
        America one great battle royale! The amendment's purpose is to guarantee
        that we the people would be able to defend ourselves from tyranny;
        defend ourselves from the bullies with guns and soldiers; defend
        ourselves from those who have forgotten the power of human kindness.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Yet, all of this means nothing if the following is not understood; this
        information is available to the public because it is important for the
        public to be acquainted with violence and evil, not so that violence and
        evil shall be perpetuated, but defended against. This website is not
        that which instigates violence, it is the abhorrent circumstances which
        people find themselves in where they feel that they must resort to
        violence. The answer to violence is not the eradication of it, because
        that is impossible. The answer is regulation and education. Educate
        yourselves, advocate for a government which serves <i>all</i> the
        people, and fight the power. Peace.
